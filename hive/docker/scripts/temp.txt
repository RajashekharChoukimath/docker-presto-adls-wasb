usage: yarn logs -applicationId <application ID> [OPTIONS]

general options are:
 -am <AM Containers>             Prints the AM Container logs for this
                                 application. Specify comma-separated
                                 value to get logs for related AM
                                 Container. For example, If we specify -am
                                 1,2, we will get the logs for the first
                                 AM Container as well as the second AM
                                 Container. To get logs for all AM
                                 Containers, use -am ALL. To get logs for
                                 the latest AM Container, use -am -1. By
                                 default, it will only print out syslog.
                                 Work with -logFiles to get other logs
 -appOwner <Application Owner>   AppOwner (assumed to be current user if
                                 not specified)
 -containerId <Container ID>     ContainerId. By default, it will only
                                 print syslog if the application is
                                 runing. Work with -logFiles to get other
                                 logs.
 -help                           Displays help for all commands.
 -logFiles <Log File Name>       Work with -am/-containerId and specify
                                 comma-separated value to get specified
                                 container log files. Use "ALL" to fetch
                                 all the log files for the container.
 -nodeAddress <Node Address>     NodeAddress in the format nodename:port
